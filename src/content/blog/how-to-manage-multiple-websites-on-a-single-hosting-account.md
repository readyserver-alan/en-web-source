title: How to Manage Multiple Websites on a Single Hosting Account
---

Ever thought of building more than one website but didn’t want to fork out extra for multiple hosting accounts? You’re not alone. Managing multiple websites on a single [hosting account](https://www.readyserver.sg/) is a smart move — if done right. This guide will walk you through the why, how, and what to watch out for.

## Why Host Multiple Websites on One Account?

### Save Money and Resources

Running several hosting accounts gets expensive fast. Using just one hosting plan means fewer bills, less fuss, and better use of your resources.

### Centralised Control and Management

With everything in one place, you can manage domains, emails, files, and databases without jumping between dashboards. It’s like having all your shops in one mall — easier to run and maintain.

## Can Your Hosting Handle It?

### Shared vs VPS vs [Dedicated Hosting](/dedicated-servers)

Not all hosting is created equal. Shared hosting is great for beginners, but performance and resource limits can be a bottleneck if you run multiple  or high-traffic sites. [VPS hosting](https://www.readyserver.sg/vps-hosting/) and [dedicated hosting](/dedicated-servers) give you more space and power, making them better for high-traffic or complex sites.

### What to Check in Your Hosting Plan

Before piling on the domains, check if your hosting plan allows multiple websites. Look for terms like “add-on domains,” “multi-site support,” and “unlimited websites.”

## Domain Setup Basics

### Add-on Domains vs Subdomains

Add-on domains share the same control panel and root hosting environment.

Each one has its own folder and domain mapping, but not completely isolated in terms of user/system-level separation (as in VPS or container environments). A subdomain is more like a branch of your main site (e.g. blog.yoursite.com). Use add-ons for distinct websites.

### How to Point Domains to Your Hosting

Buy your domain from a registrar, then update the A record or nameservers — depending on whether you're hosting DNS with your registrar or your web host. Most hosts provide a step-by-step guide or even automated tools for this.

## Use a Control Panel (Like cPanel or Plesk)

### Add Domains Through the Control Panel

Most web hosts use a control panel like cPanel. It lets you add new domains in just a few clicks. You’ll assign each one its own directory (more on that next).

### Manage Email, SSL, and File Access Easily

Your control panel also helps with setting up emails, securing each site with SSL, and controlling file access. You’ll save time and avoid tech headaches.

## Keep Files Organised

### Use Separate Folders for Each Site

Imagine stuffing all your clothes into one drawer — it’s chaos. Do the same with websites and you’ll get a mess. Create a new folder for each domain to stay tidy.

### Name Folders Clearly and Logically

Use easy-to-understand names for folders (like mybusinesssite, travelblog) to avoid confusion down the road.

## Managing Databases for Each Website

### Separate Databases for Clean Management

Each site should have its own database to prevent data mix-ups. This keeps your sites independent and safe from accidental cross-over.

### Use Tools Like phpMyAdmin

phpMyAdmin is a user-friendly tool that helps you manage databases. You can view, edit, and back them up all from your browser.

## Install a CMS (Like WordPress) for Each Site

### One-Click Installers Make It Easy

Most hosts offer one-click installers like Softaculous. Some installers don’t always install the latest version of CMS or plugins. You should immediately update everything after installation. You can set up WordPress (or other CMSs) for each domain in minutes.

### Secure Each Installation Individually

Each website should have its own login, set of plugins, and security measures. Don’t cut corners — On shared hosting, a vulnerability in one site can sometimes lead to others being affected due to shared file system or permissions issues, unless properly isolated.

## Stay Secure and Updated

### Keep Plugins and Themes Updated

Outdated themes and plugins are like open windows for cyber crooks. Always keep everything updated — and don’t ignore those update alerts!

### Enable Firewalls and SSL for Each Site

Mention that each domain must be set up separately for SSL — it’s not automatic unless the host enables auto-renewal for all domains. Use them. Pair that with a basic firewall plugin and you’re good to go.

## Monitor Performance and Resources

### Use Hosting Stats and Tools

Track how much bandwidth and storage each site uses. If one site starts hogging resources, it could slow down the rest.

### When to Upgrade Your Hosting

If your sites are getting lots of traffic, it might be time to move to VPS or [dedicated hosting](/dedicated-servers). Better safe than sorry!

## Backup Regularly

### Use Auto-Backup Tools Provided by Host

Most hosts let you schedule automatic backups. Enable this for each site to protect your work.

### Keep Off-Site Backups Just in Case

Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Keep copies of your sites on cloud storage or external drives. If something goes wrong, you’ll thank yourself later.

## Conclusion

Managing multiple websites from one hosting account isn’t just doable — it’s practical, efficient, and surprisingly simple once you know the ropes. Think of it like managing a fleet instead of one vehicle. As long as you keep things organised, stay secure, and monitor performance, you’ll cruise ahead without a hitch.

## Common Mistakes When Choosing Singapore VPS

### Mistake #1: Choosing Based on Price Alone

**The Solution:**
Compare total cost of ownership, including:
- Base price
- Backup costs
- Support tier needed
- Potential downtime costs

### Mistake #2: Ignoring Support Quality

**The Problem:**
When things go wrong (and they will), poor support means:
- Extended downtime
- Lost revenue
- Frustrated customers
- DIY troubleshooting

**The Solution:**
Test support before committing:
- Submit pre-sales question
- Check response time
- Evaluate answer quality
- Read support reviews

### Mistake #3: Over-Provisioning Resources

**The Problem:**
Buying more than needed wastes money:
- Unused CPU cycles
- Idle RAM
- Storage sitting empty

**The Solution:**
Start smaller, scale as needed:
- Begin with business-tier plan
- Monitor actual usage
- Upgrade when hitting 70-80% utilisation
- Use provider's scaling options

### Mistake #4: Ignoring Backup Strategy

**The Problem:**
Relying solely on provider backups risks:
- Data loss from provider issues
- Slow restore times
- Limited retention periods

**The Solution:**
Implement multi-layer backup:
- Provider's automated backups
- Your own backup scripts
- Off-site backup storage
- Regular restore testing

### Mistake #5: Not Testing Performance First

**The Problem:**
Marketing claims don't match reality:
- Advertised speeds not achieved

- Performance varies by time

**The Solution:**
Test before committing:

- Run actual workloads
- Test from target user locations
- Monitor over several days
